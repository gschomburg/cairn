- can i remove m_flip public property by detecting need?
    - perhaps this is an opengl thing, or can be gleaned from a unity matrix?
    - flip is needed on windows to display, not on window to vive (why!?)

- coordinates are in world space now, should distance fog use distance from headset on xz plane?


x- remove camera, and just use current camera
x- m_Camera = GetComponent<Camera>();


- pick up fog color from skybox?
